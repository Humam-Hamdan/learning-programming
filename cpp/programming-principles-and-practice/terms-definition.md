# Chapter 1

- `//` is the beginning of a comment.

- `executable` is a program which the computer can directly use.

- `main()` is the function which controls the cpp program.

- `<<` is the output parameter.

- `function` is a set of instructions which are defined under a name and returns a defined type.

- `object code` is the `*.o` file which the compiler produces from the `*.cpp` file.

- `cpp` is a high level programming language, can be used for low-level and high-level applications.

- `header file` is a file which has definitions for something which we would use in more than one source code file.

- `output` 

- `comment` lines which the compiler ignores, mainly used to explain the code and for documentation

- `IDE` integrated dev environment, one place which has most of the used tooling for a programming language

- `program` is the final product after the compiler compiles the source code and the linker links the object code and is executable by a computer

- `compiler` the tool which takes the source code and makes object code out of it

- `import` the modern way to import modules

- `source code` is the human-readable file

- `compile-time` when the compiler takes the source code and processes it

- `error` 'an error in a program is a bug'

- `library` is a set of tools which are commonly used together

- `statement` 'a part of a cpp program that specifies an aciton'

- `cout` is the character output stream function

- `linker` is the tool which take the object code and translate it into machine code

- `module` 'parts of the cpp standard library'

- `#include` is the older version of `import` and is used with header files

- `std` the standard library, which has commonly used functions

- `command line` is the TUI which is just a text input/output screen

- `bug` is a problem with the program, can be compile-time or linker-time or run-time bug

- `debuggung` is the act of searching and identifying the source of the bug and fixing it.
